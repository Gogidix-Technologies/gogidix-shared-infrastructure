# Social Commerce Ecosystem UI Design System

This design system provides a comprehensive set of UI components, design tokens, and patterns for building consistent user interfaces across all domains of the Social Commerce Ecosystem.

## Purpose

The UI Design System serves as the foundation for implementing the user interfaces defined in our UI/UX planning documents, ensuring consistency, accessibility, and localization support across all applications.

## Structure

- **src/tokens/** - Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)
- **src/components/** - Reusable UI components
- **src/themes/** - Theme configurations
- **src/utils/** - Utility functions for UI operations
- **docs/** - Documentation and guidelines

## Usage Guidelines

### Team Alpha (User-Facing Experience)

Team Alpha should use these components for implementing customer-facing interfaces, focusing on:
- Mobile responsiveness
- Localization
- Customer journey optimization
- Social commerce features

### Team Omega (Operational Systems)

Team Omega should use these components for implementing operational interfaces, focusing on:
- Data visualization
- Dashboard layouts
- Administrative workflows
- Operational efficiency

## Getting Started

1. Import design tokens for consistent styling
2. Use base components as building blocks
3. Follow accessibility guidelines for all implementations
4. Implement proper localization support

## Collaboration

Both teams should collaborate on shared components and report any issues with the design system to maintain consistency across all interfaces.
